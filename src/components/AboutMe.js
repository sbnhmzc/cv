      <p>
        I am Sabina HamziÄ‡, telecommunication engineer by school and frontend
        software engineer by choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my eight-year career, I've evolved from intern and WordPress
        developer to the current destination of front-end engineer, team lead,
        and mentor. I consider myself a highly motivated person with a superb
        work ethic, equipped with a future promising skillset, and always eager
        to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am fluent in English and Bosnian with a basic knowledge of German.
